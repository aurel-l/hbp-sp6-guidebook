Bioactive conformers
####################

`Central Nervous System (CNS) <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43772/nav/301052>`_ is a platform designed to efficiently **generate** and **parameterize** bioactive conformers of ligands binding to **neuronal** proteins.

The project is part of the Parameter generation and mechanistic studies of neuronal cascades using multi-scale molecular simulations of the **Human Brain Project**.

**CNS conformers** are generated using a powerful multilevel strategy that combines a low-level (LL) method for sampling the conformational minima and high-level (HL) ab-initio calculations for estimating their relative stability.

**CNS database** presents the results in a graphical user interface, displaying small molecule properties, analyses and generated 3D conformers. All data produced by the project is available to download.

**CNS** will contribute in the improvement of the understanding of neuronal signaling cascades by protein structure-based simulations, calculating thermodynamics and kinetics constants of the molecular processes.

Exploring of the data
=====================

These conformers are available to browse and filter through via the `web interface <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43772/nav/301052>`_.

Useful visualizations and statistical analyses are available to highlight different interesting aspects of these conformers.

These include a molecule overview, trajectory, PCA, clusters, dihedrals, and QM analyses.

Programmatical access
=====================

The data can also be obtained programatically through the REST API in order to be used in scripts, or within notebooks.

The API documentation is available `here <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/43775/nav/301095>`_.
